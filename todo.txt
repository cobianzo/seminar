To-do list and milestone plan for tx_seminars
=============================================

NOTE: This to-do list is extremely outdated and is not used anymore. It is being kept only so that the ideas in it do not get lost.

For this extension, there are still many unimplemented feature ideas. Help is very welcome! Contact the author if you want to help in any way.

If you find any bugs in this extension, please report them in the bugtracker at <https://bugs.oliverklee.com/> under the project "Seminar Manager".

Development speed of this extension mainly depends on whether it is funded. So if you'd like this extension to get developed quickly (or you need a certain feature), please pay for the author's time.

Hint regarding the items marked with [from dev-meeting 05/12], they got discussed on the developers meeting that took place at the end of 2005. Details about these points can be read in the notices of this meeting wich can be found at http://www.rimann.org/fileadmin/mario/typo3/Dev_Meeting_0512_060101.pdf (sorry, German only. If you have questions please ask.)
